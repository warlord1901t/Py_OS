# Py_OS - Python-tkinter Based Operating System Simulation

Py_OS is a basic operating system simulation implemented in Python. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) with features reminiscent of common operating systems. This project is designed for educational purposes and as a starting point for understanding GUI development in Python.

## Features

- **File Management:** Explore and manage files and folders with a basic file manager.
- **Application Management:** Download, install, and open applications through the software store.
- **User Interface (UI):** A graphical user interface with buttons, frames, and drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Settings and Customization:** Customize the background color and window opacity according to your preferences.
- **Notification and Navigation:** Receive notifications and navigate through the simulated operating system.
  

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Additional dependencies are listed in the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/warlord1901t/Py_OS/blob/main/requirements.txt) file.

2. **Installation:**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/warlord1901t/Py_OS.git
   ```

3. **Install the project dependencies:**
   - Install all the dependencies that are important for Py_OS to work
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Simulation:**
   - Navigate to the project directory and run the main script.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
      or
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

5. **Explore and Customize:**
   - Use the file manager, software store, and other features to explore and interact with the simulation.
   - Customize the appearance through the settings options.
