# Py_OS - Python Operating System Simulation

Py_OS is a basic operating system simulation implemented in Python. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) with features reminiscent of common operating systems. This project is designed for educational purposes and as a starting point for understanding GUI development in Python.

## Features

- **File Management:** Explore and manage files and folders with a basic file manager.
- **Application Management:** Download, install, and open applications through the software store.
- **User Interface (UI):** A graphical user interface with buttons, frames, and drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Settings and Customization:** Customize the background color and window opacity according to your preferences.
- **Notification and Navigation:** Receive notifications and navigate through the simulated operating system.
